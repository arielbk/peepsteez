I'm practicing coding and want to begin using GitHub as soon as I canâ€”so here I am.

This is (or will be) a simple blog layout for me to practice some layout styling in HTML and CSS.

Inspiration is heavily drawn from this free blog template: https://freebiesbug.com/psd-freebies/personal-blog-design-template/

As yet, it is not responsive at all; it simply stands as an initial practice project for simple HTML and CSS design. No doubt I will be returning to it. I have been deeply inspired for my path into webdev by P1XT and her Javascript job-ready guide: https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/job-ready-javascript-edition-2.0.md
