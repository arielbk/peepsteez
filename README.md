I'm practicing coding and want to begin using GitHub as soon as I canâ€”so here I am.

This is (or will be) a simple blog layout for me to practice some layout styling in HTML and CSS.

Inspiration is heavily drawn from this free blog template: https://freebiesbug.com/psd-freebies/personal-blog-design-template/

As yet, it is not responsive at all; it simply stands as an initial practice project for simple HTML and CSS design.
